#2.	Task: Explore the dataset's structure and initial insights: str(flights), summary(flights), and head(flights). Include all these functions in separate code cells and write your key takeaways from each of these functions.

str(flights)

# shows real-world flights data from NYC airports. The data set shows the flights, airline, plane, airtime, distance of the flight and more. 

# The data has a mix of integers, numeric values, characters and datetime. 
```
```{r}
summary(flights)

# displays the max, min, mean and quartiles for the different values. 

# There are NA values in dep_delay, dep_time, arr_tive, ar_delay and air_time. This could be due to flight cancellations. 

```
```{r}
head(flights)

#shows the flight data including the depature and arrivals times, delays as well as destination 

# easy to spot if there were to be any NA due to the table format 


```

#3 Filtering and summarizing: Task: Create a function. Write a function avg_monthly_dep_delay() that takes a carrier as input and calculates the average departure delay for that carrier for each month of the year. The function should return a vector of length 12 with the average delays.

  return(avg_delays)
}

```{r}
#4Function & Plot: Task: Write a function plot_monthly_delay_trend() that takes a carrier as input, uses avg_monthly_dep_delay() to calculate the average monthly departure delays, and creates a line plot to visualize the trend of delays over the months.
